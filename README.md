# long_ariphmetic
This repo implies long ariphmetic class you can use in your projects freely.

1. **BigNum a{"x...x"}** - creates a long integer with value x...x
2. **c = a+b** - something like that is using of ariphmetical operations defined in this class (addition,subtitution,multiplication)
   - in this example we write a value of a+b into c, where a,b,c are long integers
3. **c.output()** - printing the long integer value (always use output method to print the value)
